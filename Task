Question: What is the difference between window, screen, and document in Javascript?
Answer:
	        Window is the main JavaScript object root, the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
	        Screen or window.screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
	        Document or window.document is the main object of the potentially visible document object model/DOM.
	        Since window is the global object you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window.
